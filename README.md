# PaymentGatewayIntegration
This is my project for an Internship at Sparks Foundation. This project shows how to integrate payment console into the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Razor pay is used as a test mode API button in the website for providing various kinds of payment options. This website provides an easy way of making payments.
